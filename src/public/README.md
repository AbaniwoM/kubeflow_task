# Building and Deploying

This project was built with React.js and Material-ui. It is basically a Dashboard for Kubeflow. It is divided into 3 main components:
1) The Header
2) The Sidebar
3) The Ecosystem

- The Header does not have any functionality yet
- The Sidebar has some functionality at the Profile, ProfileSpec and Status texts to the left. When you click these texts, a modal appears for you to update your profile
- The Ecosystem contains data returned from the API of subapps under Kubeflow. These data are not displayed for now.

### In the project directory, you can run:
`yarn start`

### To Run the app in the development mode:
Open [https://kubeflow-task.netlify.app/](https://kubeflow-task.netlify.app/) to view it in your browser.

### Front-End Components
Client side code resides in the public directory in the src folder.
